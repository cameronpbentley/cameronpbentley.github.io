        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong> I’m originally from a small town about an hour and a half from Charlotte, and I’ve spent my whole life there so far. It’s one of those places where everyone knows everyone, and while I’m excited for new experiences, it’ll always feel like home.</li>
            <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong> I graduated from an early college high school so I have a diploma as well as an associates degree in digital media and mobile app development from my local community college.</li>
            <li><strong>Background in this Subject:</strong> Hands-on experience with coding projects, algorithm implementation, UI/UX designing, and app development. My focus on human-computer interaction has allowed me to explore how users engage with technology and apply that knowledge to create solutions.</li>
            <li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> Windows 10 and 11 (PC and laptop).</li>
